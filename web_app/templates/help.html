					<h4>What is Network Portal</h4>
					<div><p>The Network Portal is a database of gene transcription regulatory networks and enables exploration, annotation and comparative analysis.</p>
					<p> Deciphering the complexity of biological systems requires a systems-level view of regulatory players and their interactions. However, inference of these complex interactions is challenging, and further, visualizing and analyzing these interactions often requires advanced computational expertise, tools and resources.</p> 
					<p>Network Portal provides analysis and visualization tools for selected gene regulatory networks to aid researchers in biological discovery and hypothesis development. It provides a user-friendly interface, extensive search capabilities and a number of visualization tools. We are also constantly adding regulatory networks for new species. Increasing the number of network models will also enable comparative network biology. We are also developing tools for comparing network models and these will be integrated into the portal as soon as they are available.</p>
					<p> The Network Portal also acts as a gateway for the Gaggle Workflow. Gaggle Workflow makes the life of researchers easier by taking over the burden of repetitive analysis tasks. Integration with Network Portal provides full access to automated analysis of network models and associated biological information.</p>
					</div>
					<h4>Navigating Network Portal</h4>

							<h5 id="network">Network Tab</h5>
							<img src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}images/help_images/gene-network.png" align="right"><p>If the gene is associated with a regulon(s), its connection to given regulons along with other members of that regulon are shown as a network using CytoscapeWeb. In this view, green circular nodes represent regulon member genes, purple diamonds represent regulon motifs and red triangles represent regulators. Each node is connected to regulon(s) (Biclusters) via edges. This representation provides a quick overview of all genes, regulators and motifs for regulons. It also allows one to see shared genes/motifs/regulators among different regulons. Network representation is interactive. You can zoom in/out and move nodes/edges around. Clicking on a node will open up a window to give more details.</br> The information shown for genes includes the locus tag, organism, genomic coordinates, NCBI gene ID, whether it is transcription factor and any associated functional information. For regulators, the number of regulons is shown in addition to gene details. For motifs, e-value, consensus sequence and sequence logo will be shown. For regulons, expression profile plot, motif information, functional associations and motif locations for each member of the regulon will be shown. You can pin information boxes by using the button in the box title and open up additional ones on the same screen for comparative analysis.</p>								
							<h5 id="regulation">Regulation Tab</h5>   
								<img src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}images/help_images/gene-regulation.png" align="right"> <p> The regulation tab for each gene includes regulatory influences such as environmental factors or transcription factors or their combinations identified by regulatory network inference algorithms. If the gene is a member of a regulon, regulators influencing that regulon are also considered to regulate the gene. The regulators table lists the total number of regulatory influences, regulators, regulons and type of the influence. You can see a description of the regulator inside the tooltip when you mouseover. In certain cases the regulatory influence is predicted to be the result of the combination of two influences. These are indicated as a combiner in the column labeled "Operator". For transcription factors, an additional table next to regulator table will be shown. This table shows regulons that are influenced by the transcription factor. </br>
									<h5 id="motifs">Motifs Tab</h5>   
									<img src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}images/help_images/gene-motifs.png" align="right"><p> Network inference algorithm uses de novo motif prediction for assigning genes to regulons. If there are any motifs identified in the upstream region of a gene, the motif will be shown here. For each motif sequence logo, consensus and e-value will be shown.<br>

Therefore, interested researchers can share information, questions and updates for a particular gene. Users can obtain login information by registering for our website. Alternatively, they can use their Facebook or Google accounts to connect to this page. Each regulon and gene page includes a comments tab that lists the history of interactions for that gene. You can browse the history, make updates, raise questions and share these activities within the social web. In future releases of the network portal, we are planning to create a personal space for each user that contains all the analysis steps performed by the user along with relevant information. It will be possible to share these personal spaces with other users.</p>

			<div id="tabs-2"> <h5> What is Gaggle?</h5>
				<div id="accordion" class="">
					<h4> Overview</h4>
					<div><p>The practice of systems biology depends upon many software tools, operating on many kinds of data from many different sources. Each of these tools typically excels at one (or a few) types of analysis with one (or a few) types of data. A crucial challenge, therefore, is to combine the capabilities of these and other, forthcoming tools to create a data exploration and analysis environment which can do justice to the variety and complexity of systems biology.</p>
						<p>The Gaggle is a simple, open-source Java software environment which solves this problem. Guided by the classic software engineering strategy of separation of concerns and a policy of semantic flexibility, it combines existing popular programs and web resources into a user-friendly, rich, and easily extended environment in which to do systems biology.</p>

						<p>We currently support a number of geese -- our name for any open source software which is adapted to run in the gaggle. This adaptation is generally only a small amount of programming work. Once gaggled the program can broadcast and receive any of a small number of data types which together constitute an adequate basis for exploratory analysis in systems biology. These data types include:</br>
						<ol>
							<li><strong>Name list</strong> (i.e., these genes are interesting)</li>
							<li><strong>Bicluster:</strong> Name list combined with a condition list (i.e., these genes are interesting in these conditions)</li>
							<li><strong>Tuple</strong> (replaces HashMap): a collection of name/value pairs</li>
							<li><strong>Matrix:</strong> rows and columns, each named, containing numerical data</li>
							<li><strong>Network:</strong> a collection of nodes and edges, with arbitrary tuples associated with each</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
					
					<h4> Current Geese</h4>
					<div class="post-tab">
						<img align="right"src="http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net/docs/geese/schematic.png" />
						The Boss acts as a hub that routes messages from one goose to another.
						<ul>
							<li><a href="http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net/docs/geese/boss.php">Gaggle Boss</a> <span class="ui-state-error"> Workflow Enabled</span></li>
						</ul>
						A database or software program that is capable of communicating with the Gaggle framework

							</ul>
						<p>Gaggle is designed to make it easy to connect programs and databases with a minimum of effort. There are several <a href="http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net/docs/geese/thirdparty/">third party Gaggle-connected applications</a>.</p>
						</div>
						<h4> Gaggle Development Principles</h4>
						<div><style type="text/css">
							A:link {color:#3300ff}
							A:visited {text-decoration: none}
							A:active {text-decoration: none}
							A:hover {text-decoration: underline; color: red;}
							</style>
							<h4>Core components</h4>

						<ul>
							<li> The core components of the Gaggle are the <strong>Boss</strong> and the <strong>Goose</strong> interfaces. Because all Geese depend on these interfaces, changes to them require changes to all Geese. Therefore, changes to these interfaces must be carefully controlled to maintain compatibility.

								<ul>
									<li> The <strong>Boss</strong> and <strong>Goose</strong> interfaces should be revised rarely and carefully.</li>
									<li> The right to change core components is reserved by the Baliga Lab at ISB.</li>
									<li> <a href="/mantis" title="requested_features">Feature requests</a> for core components will be carefully considered.</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>Loose Coupling</h4>
						<ul>
							<li> The Gaggle is designed as a system of loosely coupled components:
								<ul>
									<li> Almost any desired functionality can be implemented as a Goose.
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<h4>Data Types</h4>
						<ul>
							<li> Existing Data types:
								<ul>
									<li> name list
									</li>
									<li> tuple
									</li>
									<li> matrix
									</li>
									<li> network
									</li>
									<li> cluster
									</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
						<ul>
							<li> A few general data types are preferred over special-purpose data types.
							</li>
							<li> Almost all biological data can be represented as one of the existing types.
							</li>
							<li> New data types should be introduced only when necessary.
							</li>
						</ul>

					<h4>Semantic Flexibility</h4>
					<ul>
						<li> Since the Gaggle is a merely a conduit for transferring data between applications, it does not need to assign specific meaning or roles to the data.
						</li>
						<li> Interpreting the data is left up to the user and the applications.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Open Development</h4>
					<ul>
						<li> The Gaggle is open source.
						</li>
						<li> The <a href="http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net/svn/gaggle/gaggle/trunk" class="urlextern" target="_new" title="http://gaggle.systemsbiology.net/svn/gaggle/gaggle/trunk"  rel="nofollow">source repository</a> for the core components of the Gaggle will be maintained at ISB.
						</li>
						<li> Permission to commit to the source repository will be granted on a case-by-case basis. Reading the source repository is open to all.
						</li>
						<li> Contributions of code, especially new Geese, are welcome.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>The Gaggle Paper</h4>
					<p>These principles are more fully explained in the
					<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/7/176" target="_blank">Gaggle paper</a>.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
			</div> 
			   
			<div id="tabs-3"> <h5> Gaggle Workflow</h5>
				<div id="accordion2" class="">
					<h4> Workflow Concept</h4>
					<div>
						<p><img align="right" src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}images/workflow_concept.png">Researchers often come across repetitive analysis tasks where the same/different inputs are analyzed by using the same/different tools multiple times. In addition, a number of analyses tools may need to be used for analyzing the same set of inputs. The workflow allows automation of these repetitive tasks by linking inputs and outputs for various desktop and web based analysis tools. </p>
						<p>The workflow is developed based on our extensive experience with Gaggle in exchanging data between independently developed software tools and databases to enable interactive exploration of systems biology data. Exporting the "boss" and "goose" concept into the workflow, each goose becomes a module in the workflow. These modules can be added into a workflow sequentially or in parallel and can accept output from other modules in the workflow. Once the workflow is built, it can be saved into a personal workspace and can be called out anytime to invoke the same analysis steps.</p> 
						
					</div>
					<h4> Case 1 - Discovering Detailed Regulon Information</h4>
					<div> <img align="right" src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}images/workflow_case-1.png">
					<p> This exercise starts with a regulon in Network Portal. We will use a very simple workflow idea that includes broadcasting data via Firegoose to multiple web resources simultaneously. We will broadcast a Namelist of regulon members to DAVID for functional enrichment analysis and to Entrez to access NCBI tools. We will also broadcast motif PSSM information to STAMP in order to identify matches to known motifs.</p>
						<b>STEPS:</b>
						<ol>
							<li>Start <span class="small red awesome">Gaggle boss</span></li>
							<li>First we will collect regulon info from a website by adding a <span class="small awesome">firegoose</span> module. 
								Path to Firefox should be automatically detected. Leave subaction unchanged. Enter data url, or web resource to get regulon information.
								In this example we will use one of Methanococcus maripaludis GRN regulon. (http://baliga.systemsbiology.net/cmonkey/enigma/mmp/cmonkey_4.8.8_mmp_1661x58_11_Oct_11_16:14:07/htmls/cluster0114.html)
								</li>
							<li>Add <span class="small awesome">firegoose</span> module for DAVID.
								Select the "DAVID" option from subaction menu and connect to the first Firegoose module.
								<code>Manual: You need to convert the Namelist to a DAVID Id list once it has been submitted to DAVID.</code></li>
							<li>Add firegoose module for Entrez. Select "Entrez Protein" subaction and connect to the first Firegoose module.</li>
							<li>Last, we will add another firegoose module for STAMP. Select the "STAMP" subaction and connect to the first Firegoose module.</li>
								<code>Manual: You need to select an appropriate database for motif searching on the STAMP site.</code></li>
							<li> Optional: Save your workflow</li>
							<li> Run your workflow by using <span class="small green awesome">"Run"</span> button in the control panel.</li>	
						</ol>
					</div>
					<h4> Case 2 - Analyzing gene expression data</h4>
					<div> <img align="right" src="{{ STATIC_PREFIX }}images/workflow_case-2.png">
					<p> The second exercise includes both desktop applications and web resources. The aim of this workflow is to automate analysis of gene expression data and identify functional associations, functional enrichments and associated regulatory network modules. We will start by opening a gene expression file (tab delimited) in Mev. After performing statistical analyses, we will broadcast selected genes via Firegoose to KEGG (Metabolic pathway enrichment) and EMBL Strings (Functional associations). Inparallel, we will also open a Network model in Cytoscape and broadcast our gene list to the network in order to select network modules that include these genes.</p>   
						<b>STEPS:</b>
						<ol>
							<li>Start <span class="small red awesome">Gaggle boss</span></li>
							<li>We will add mev module to open a gene expression file. Leave subaction unchanged. If you are opening the gene expression file from the web, enter the url; otherwise, enter the path to the file on your computer.								In this example we will use gene expression data coming from studying energy metabolism for Desulfovibrio vulgaris.
								We will compare gene expression upon growth on Pyruvate+Sulfate versus Pyruvate/Fermentation.
								<code>Manual: After your workflow has started Mev will load the gene expression file. You can perform SAM analyses and then select genes that are upregulated in Pyruvate/Fermentation conditions and then broadcast them to the workflow.</code></li>
								</li>
							<li>Add firegoose module for EMBL Strings. Select "EMBL Strings" subaction and connect to MEV module. The EMBL Strings website will use the Namelist for our selected genes and search against the Strings database to identify functional associations. The resulting functional association network will be shown and captured in the workflow report.</li>
							<li>Add <span class="small awesome">firegoose</span> module for EMBL Strings
								Select "EMBL Strings" subaction and connect to MEV module. EMBL Strings website will use Namelist for our selected genes and search against Strings database 
								to identify functional associations. Resulting functional association network will be shown and captured in the workflow report.</li>
							<li>Last, we will add <span class="small awesome">Cytoscape</span> module to open a network file. (For this example we will use GRN model for D. vulgaris).
								Connect Cytoscape module to MEV module and enter path to your cytoscape network file (web or desktop). When workflow is started cytoscape will open 
								your network file and capture broadcast list from MEV. Upregulated genes will be selected in the network for further network manipulations.
								</li>
							<li> Optional: Save your workflow</li>
							<li> Run your workflow by using <span class="small green awesome">"Run"</span> button in the control panel.</li>
